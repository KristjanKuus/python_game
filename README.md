## CONTROLS
    Q to quit
    Space to shoot
    W / Up arrow to move up
    S / Down arrow move down
    D / Right arrow move right
    A / Left arrow move left

### DEPENDENCIES
Depends on the pygame plugin. Has only been tested on windows 10, but can most likely run on anything else that can run python.

### RUNNING THE GAME
To run the game, simply execute game.py. I played and coded it in pycharm, so that's where it will function the best.

### DESCRIPTION
**Click on the play button to start the game.**

 Shoot the rapidly approaching megustas to momentarily survive and advance to the next wave. On the next wave, the megustas will have quicker movement, but you, in turn, will move faster, shoot more bullets at once, have thicker bullets and have bullets move faster.
